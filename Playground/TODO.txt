Things to do:
    - Look at `ErrorFinder(Normalizer)` in the errors.py class
        The errorfinder seems to be used to traverse the AST with a self made scope
        to check wether there are errors present that would've gotten past the parsing.
        I should make sure that this is also a correct error finder for Yogurt
        and change it if that is not the case.
